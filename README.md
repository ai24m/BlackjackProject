## Description:
Using Object-Oriented programming, the Blackjack Project was constructed to run a text-based game simulation between a dealer and player, otherwise the user. The project required the use of communication between classes and utilized collection types to organize and manage data. The structure of the application had to implement the rules of Blackjack. For the purpose to simplicity, betting or gambling was not implemented. The objective remains: the player should try to reach a hand value of 21 without a "Bust", or going over 21, while at the same time holding a hand value larger than the dealer.

The game begins by shuffling the deck and dealing both the dealer, one card being concealed, and the player two cards. Afterwards, the player is prompted to "Hit", add a card to their hand, or "Stand", holds current hand. The dealer, by default, reveals the hidden card after the player asks for a "Hit" and only draws if their hand value is greater or equal to 17. Otherwise, both player hand value and dealer hand value are compared and prints a result of whether the player "Won", "Lost", or had a "Push", or tie.
	
## Challenges:
Having never played Blackjack prior to programming the application, learning the rules and implementing the logic was a very difficult challenge. There was a lot of time planning, sketching, and scratching for the design that went into the construction of the application. After the logic was ordered, implementing the classes and their methods to string together a functioning game took less time than the actual planning. It was very challenging and fun at the same time to find errors in the winning and losing logic after playing through the application many many times.

## Technologies/Resources Used:
*Skilldistillery github class resources:  implementing methods, abstract classes, polymorphism, using debugger in Eclipse

*Stackoverflow: catching user input errors to prevent early termination of program

*Bicyclecards.com: learning the rules of Blackjack and taking note of exceptions in game play

*Eclipse
